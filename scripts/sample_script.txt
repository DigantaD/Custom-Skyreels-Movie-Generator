Hey everyone! I'm here at P-TAL's brand new store in Vasant Kunj, and trust me- this place is absolutely stunning! 

P-TAL is all about reviving India's rich heritage of brass, copper, and kansa. Every piece you see here is handcrafted by artisans, making it not just a cookware or serveware- but a piece of tradition you can bring into your home.

And with the festive season around the corner, this store is literally a gifting paradise. From timeless cookware to beautiful dinner sets and serveware- everything here makes for gifts that last a lifetime.

What I love is how P-TAL combines sustainability with culture. So when you shop here, you're not just buying something beautiful, you're also supporting Indian artisans and their craft.

So if you're in Delhi, you HAVE to come visit the new P-TAL store at Vasant Kunj. Trust me, you'll walk out with something special for yourself and your loved ones.
